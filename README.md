# A-BI-OBJECTIVE-HYPER-HEURISTIC-SUPPORT-VECTOR-MACHINE-FOR-CYBER-SECURITY-IN-BIG-DATA-
The project develops a bi-objective hyper-heuristic framework to optimize Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for cyber-security, balancing accuracy and complexity. It automates parameter tuning using adaptive strategies and evaluates performance on real-world datasets like Microsoft Malware Classification.
